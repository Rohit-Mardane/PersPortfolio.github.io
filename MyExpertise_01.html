                    card fraud while mitigating risk. The application performs predictive analytics, tracks risk
                    patterns, and monitors authorizations using national and global data to stay ahead of evolving fraud
                    trends.

                    The services are customized for different businesses and banking models. As the application evolved,
                    its UI and functionalities frequently changed and improved.</p><br>

                    including Analysts Training Materials, User Interface Guides, and XML-based HTML files for the Help
                    and Support section. I served as the single point of contact for all documentation needs. <br><br>

                    I worked on this project for three years and completed rigorous training to understand fraud case
                    investigations and fraud alert rule creation for financial institutions. This knowledge enabled me
                    to deliver documentation that stood out to customers and clients.</p>

                <h2>Initiative 1: <span>Automated Information Extraction</span> </h2>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <img class="icon" src="BD_IIPConDis.png" alt="Fintech">
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">In this initiative, I proposed and developed an MVP for an automated
                    information extraction application using Python and the RAG module. The solution is designed to
                    automatically generate technical documentation for any software or application. It serves as a
                    generic platform that collates information and transforms it into a structured document draft.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Business Requirements</h3>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">After observing the role of documentation in the software development
                    lifecycle of companies with high project volumes and large-scale deliverables, it is clear that
                    documentation is often deprioritized, created late in the cycle, or produced inconsistently. This
                    causes delays in releases, incomplete technical references, and extra rework. The issue becomes even
                    more critical in confidential and sensitive projects, where missing or poor documentation directly
                    affects progress and compliance.<br><br>
                    Manual documentation is time-consuming, repetitive, and error-prone, even in Agile workflows.
                    Project teams including Project Managers, Business Analysts, Developers, and Quality Analystsseldom
                    maintain documents in a
                    standard format with sufficient technical details. As a result, projects frequently lack the right
                    information at the right time.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">To resolve these challenges, the project requires an automated
                    documentation solution that:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 45px;">
                    <li>Works within existing development workflows.</li>
                    <li>Produces standardized, accurate, and up-to-date documents across all stages.</li>
                    <li>Reduces manual effort, rework, and review cycles.</li>
                    <li>Scales across multiple projects and product lines.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Solution Proposed</h3>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">The MVP was designed to automate documentation by extracting, organizing,
                    and generating structured drafts directly from project resources. Built in Python with a
                    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, the solution combined rule-based preprocessing with
                    AI-assisted draft generation. The goal was to demonstrate how documentation could shift from a
                    manual afterthought to an integrated and intelligent process.</p><br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">The workflow included the following components:</p>
                <ol style="margin-left: 45px;">
                    <li><span>Content Extraction and Classification</span>
                        Multiple parsing libraries—such as pdfreader, python-docx, and Pandas—handled heterogeneous
                        inputs including PDFs, Word documents, CSVs, and links from repositories like Confluence and
                        SharePoint. Extracted content was normalized and segmented into coherent units, which were then
                        grouped into topics and subtopics through embeddings and clustering techniques.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Node and Super Node Mapping</span>
                        Each extracted unit was represented as a Node, with related Nodes clustered into Super Nodes
                        that reflected higher-level structures such as headings or service groupings. The mapping rules,
                        categories, and schema definitions were stored in SQLite, while JSON/YAML configurations enabled
                        quick adaptation to new projects without code changes.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Feature Tagging</span><br>
                        Metadata—such as document type, information level, and content category—was attached to every
                        Node and persisted in SQLite. This provided structured consistency across all generated drafts
                        and laid the foundation for scalable reuse.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>RAG-Based Draft Generation</span><br>
                        The RAG pipeline was prompted with Nodes, metadata, and predefined mapping rules to produce the
                        first draft of the documentation. This integration allowed the generative model to operate
                        within clear structural boundaries, ensuring that the output was both coherent and aligned with
                        the extracted resources.</li>
                    <li><span>Confidence Scoring</span><br>
                        Each draft was evaluated against the source materials, producing a composite confidence score
                        broken down into five dimensions:
                        <ul style="margin-left: 25px;">
                            <li>Company Standard Language</li>
                            <li>Document Format</li>
                            <li>Topic Relevance</li>
                            <li>Checklist Compliance</li>
                            <li>Technical Writing Standards</li>
                        </ul>
                        The scoring relied on a hybrid approach combining regex validation, clustering-based similarity,
                        and rule-based checks, with all criteria defined and managed in SQLite.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Interactive TOC Preview</span><br>
                        A dynamic Table of Contents view allowed users to navigate the draft, open sections, and edit
                        content inline. This streamlined the review cycle and removed the dependency on external editing
                        tools.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Final Output</span><br>
                        The enhanced draft could then be downloaded or shared, ready for further refinement or direct
                        integration into delivery pipelines.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Impact and Scalability</h3>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    The MVP demonstrated that documentation traditionally consuming a significant share of the
                    development lifecycle can be generated almost instantly in a structured and consistent format. While
                    the first version employed primarily rule-based techniques with RAG augmentation, the architecture
                    is inherently scalable. With deeper NLP integration, adaptive mappings, and machine learning–driven
                    scoring, the framework can evolve into a fully intelligent documentation platform capable of
                    supporting large-scale, enterprise environments.</p>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">I received <span>a Wall of Fame Award for the Month of September 2023
                    </span> as a recognition of my proposal and MVP and added to a cross functional team for RAG
                    Agent development and experimentation.

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <img class="icon" src="BD_IIPConDis.png" alt="Fintech">
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">In this initiative, I contributed as a sandbox tester and feature
                    developer who helped improve the user experience and validate the desired results.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Business Requirements</h3>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">There was a need of information extractor that can parsed through the hugh
                    pile of scan document stored in different data sets and provide the information based on the prompt
                    shared by the user. These information includes contract numbers, dates, parties involved, and key
                    terms, etc. Since most of the documents are unstructured and stored in various formats, extracting
                    relevant information poses a significant challenge. Some documents may contain handwritten notes,
                    while others are scanned images with varying degrees of clarity. <br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">To resolve these challenges, the initiative requires a data mining
                    solution
                    that:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 45px;">
                    <li>Enables user to select repositories or data sources for analysis.</li>
                    <li>Enables to write a query or prompt to extract specific information.</li>
                    <li>Enables user to export results in various formats.</li>
                    <li>Should not store the data once the session ends.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Solution Proposed</h3>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">The team built a stateless, session-scoped RAG pipeline that ingests
                    mixed-format
                    contract files (PDF scans, images, DOCX, CSV), performs OCR + layout parsing, normalizes content,
                    and answers user prompts by retrieving relevant passages and extracting structured fields (contract
                    number, dates, parties, key terms). The system deletes all artifacts at session end.</p><br>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">The workflow included the following components:</p>
                <ol style="margin-left: 45px;">
                    <li><span>Data Ingestion</span>
                        Users could upload documents or select repositories such as SharePoint, Confluence, or local
                        datasets. Each session was isolated and temporary, ensuring that no data was stored beyond its
                        lifecycle.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Preprocessing and OCR</span>
                        The system handled different formats—PDFs, Word documents, CSVs, and scanned images. OCR engines
                        processed low-quality scans and handwritten notes, while layout parsing preserved tables and
                        headers. All extracted text was normalized into consistent chunks with metadata such as file
                        name and page reference.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Content Indexing</span><br>
                        Text chunks were embedded using transformer-based models and stored in a session-only in-memory
                        vector index. This enabled semantic retrieval without persisting any information after the
                        session.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Query and Retrieval</span><br>
                        When a user entered a prompt (for example, “List the contract numbers and effective dates”), the
                        system retrieved the most relevant text segments. A hybrid approach combined semantic similarity
                        with lightweight rule-based extraction to ensure accuracy.</li>
                    <li><span>Field Extraction</span><br>
                        Critical fields such as contract numbers, dates, and parties were identified using a mix of
                        regex patterns, named-entity recognition, and proximity-based matching. Key terms and clauses
                        were detected using keyword and embedding similarity, ensuring coverage of standard contract
                        elements like termination, confidentiality, and governing law.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Results and Preview</span><br>
                        The output was presented in a structured table with values, confidence scores, and citations
                        linking back to the original page or section. An interactive preview allowed users to review
                        results before exporting.
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Export and Cleanup</span><br>
                        Results could be exported in multiple formats, including CSV, Excel, or JSON. At the end of the
                        session, all temporary data—files, indexes, and caches—was automatically deleted to maintain
                        security and compliance.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Impact and Scalability</h3>
                <p style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    The MVP demonstrated how unstructured contract data, often scattered and inconsistent in quality,
                    can be transformed into reliable, queryable information. By combining OCR, rule-based extraction,
                    and a RAG pipeline, the solution offered both flexibility and accuracy while remaining stateless.
                    The design also lays a foundation for scaling into a more intelligent contract analysis platform by
                    introducing layout-aware models, domain-specific ontologies, and learning-based confidence scoring
                    in future iterations.</p>
